Shuriken Beat Slicer
====================

Shuriken is an open-source beat slicer which leverages the power of aubio's beat and onset detection algorithms. A simple Qt4 interface makes it easy to slice up drum loops and assign samples to MIDI keys, while JUCE takes care of handling audio and MIDI behind the scenes.

This project is still in the early stages of development. Come back later!
