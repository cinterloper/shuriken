{"name":"Shuriken","tagline":"Shuriken Beat Slicer","body":"# Shuriken Beat Slicer\r\n\r\nShuriken is an open source beat slicer which harnesses the power of aubio's onset detection algorithms and Rubber Band's time stretching capabilities. A simple Qt4 interface makes it easy to slice up drum loops, assign individual drum hits to MIDI keys, and change the tempo of loops in real-time. The JUCE library takes care of handling audio and MIDI behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nMain features:\r\n\r\n* onset and beat-of-the-bar detection (via aubio)\r\n* calculate BPM\r\n* time stretching in offline or real-time mode (via rubberband)\r\n* sync BPM of a drum loop to JACK transport\r\n* slice and move waveform sections around\r\n* each audio slice automatically assigned to its own MIDI key\r\n* join and delete audio slices\r\n* apply gain, gain ramp, normalise, and reverse\r\n* set loop markers\r\n* ALSA and JACK MIDI\r\n* LADISH L1 session management (also compatible with NSM via nsm-proxy)\r\n* zoom waveform in and out\r\n* import a wide range of audio file formats (via libsndfile and the built-in sndlib library)\r\n* export audio slices in WAV, AIFF, AU, FLAC, or Ogg format, with options for encoding and sample rate\r\n* export Hydrogen Drumkit, SFZ, Akai .pgm, or MIDI file\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
